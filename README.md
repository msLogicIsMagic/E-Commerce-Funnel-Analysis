This dataset is a real world dataset sourced from a UK-based online retailer. This is a good sized dataset that will allow for advanced analytics while not being so huge as to slow down your system.

In this project, I will be exploring the more advanced features of Power BI. I will be analyzing the customer's purchasing behaviour, attempting to discover patterns in the sales funnel and segment customers using RFM(Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to identify high-value segments and areas for improvement.
